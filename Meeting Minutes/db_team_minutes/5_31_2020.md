1. Incoming data streams

    a. Content of data (fields and types)

    b. Speed and size of data

    c. Delivery medium (integration with scraping layer)

    d. Real-time? Manual data entry?

High-level data architecture

Consensus on roughly 3-tiered architecture? (data lake for raw data ingest, ETL transformations, and data warehouse for modeling and delivery)

Technology

Cloud hosting
Tools (db, etl, orchestration, etc)

Who pays for this stuff?
Data modeling and schema design - I say we leave this for a later conversation as it's a big initiative in and of itself
